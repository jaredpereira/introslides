                    <p>A set of Identites that share a trait, skill, or quality</p>
                    <p>Each concept has parents and children</p>

                    <h3>The concept tree</h3>
                    <p>Each concept is a subset of it's parents.</p>
                    <small>i.e it's members are also members of parents</small>
                    <p>This forms a hierarchical ontology that defines the relationships between communities and knowledge</p>

                    <h3>How do we get meaning from the crowd?</h3>
                    <p>Assessors' inputs are weighed against each other.</p>
                    <p>A majority in consensus gets rewarded</p>
                    <p>Those not in consensus get punished</p>

                    <h3>What does this give us?</h3>
                    <p>A decentralized <i>scalable</i> mechanism for creating credentials that are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>directly tied to the consensus of the communities around them</li>
                        <li>inherently participatory, not exclusionary</li>
                        <li>scalable and secure</li>

                <section>
                    <p>We can use these to build independant communities, systems, and structures, that can anchor identity attributes to a single source</p>
